# Pico-8 Development Tools
This repo includes snippets, demo carts and libraries to help make Pico-8 games.

Some of the code is my own, a lot of it is taken from the Pico-8 Community and
tweaked a bit my me so I could understand it...or just make a nice wrapper for it.

All the code here is intended to be a *starting point* for your own development.
Change, tweak and reuse code as you need.
